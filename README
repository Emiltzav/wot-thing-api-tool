This tool is created in the context of my thesis. 
It runs on development setup and need configuration to be deployed for public access.

For simplicity purposes, ports and hosts are defined as constant variables inside the function needing them (This is not safe for production).

Run Instructions:

a) Run backend server steps:
    
    1) Enable python virtual environment: venv/Scripts/activate
    2) Run uvicorn server (port 8080): python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --reload

b) Run frontend steps:
